# TODO

- [ ] Add a docstring to defrule itself
- [x] Remove dependency on medley
- [ ] We should have a predicate variable? which means a symbol which starts with a question mark,
      for the :from spec.
- [ ] Figure out how eav-map can handle reverse attributes in a way that isn't a Datomicism, e.g.
      a :db/reverse-attribute ?
